How can earthly words describe it!

The man himself, for such I may call him, was fully fifteen feet in height and, <strong>on Earth<\/strong>, would have weighed some four hundred pounds.

Some were surveying me with expressions which I afterward discovered marked extreme astonishment, and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that I had not molested their young.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Like its master, it was entirely devoid of hair, but was of a dark slate color and exceeding smooth and glossy. <\/li><li>Its belly was white, and its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid yellow at the feet. <\/li><li>The feet themselves were heavily padded and nailless, which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their approach, and, in common with a multiplicity of legs, is a characteristic feature of the fauna of Mars.<\/li><li>The highest type of man and one other animal, the only mammal existing on Mars, alone have well-formed nails, and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in existence there.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>They were conversing together in low tones, and gesticulating and pointing toward me.
